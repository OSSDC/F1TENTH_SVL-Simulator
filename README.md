This repository contains all information for working with F1TENTH and the SVL Simulator


# Maps
This folder contains the asset files for the 3D Unity Maps that can be used in the SVL Simulator together with the F1TENTH vehicle. The corresponding 2D racetrack information, centerline of the racetracks and optimal racelines can be found in the [F1TENTH Racetrack Repository](https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_racetracks/)
